# 3d-ai

Welcome to my Applied AI and 3D Tools project repository! This repository is part of my journey exploring the intersection of AI and 3D modeling, animation, and design. Here, I’ll document my progress, tools, and techniques, as well as experiment with various AI models to enhance the 3D creative workflow.

## Overview

This project is focused on integrating AI and 3D tools for creating efficient workflows and producing compelling visuals. My goal is to combine advanced AI models with traditional 3D tools, experimenting with processes that could benefit artists and designers in fields like animation, VFX, game development, and 3D digital art.
