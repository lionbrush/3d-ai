# 3. The Rigging & Motion-Capture Enhancement Method

**Description**: Once models are built, this approach covers the process of AI-assisted rigging and motion capture to bring characters to life. This phase leverages AI for automated rigging and integrates motion-capture data to capture lifelike movements or stylized animation.

**Focus Areas**:
- Using AI to auto-rig characters and refine weights.
- Integrating and refining motion capture data for expressive animations.
- Experimenting with AI-driven procedural animations for repetitive motions (like breathing, blinking).

**Tools**: Motion Capture AI, Rokoko Studio, ControlNet for pose adjustments.
