# Introduction to Applied AI and 3D Tools Project

## About Me

Hello! My name is HAJ, and I’m currently working on integrating AI into 3D modeling, animation, and design workflows. With a background as a 3d generalist, I’m excited to explore how AI can streamline and enhance the creative process in 3D art, animation, & VFX.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to investigate and document how AI can contribute to the 3D workflow. By leveraging advanced AI models and combining them with traditional 3D tools, I aim to:
- **Enhance 3D modeling efficiency**: Using AI tools to assist with tasks like model generation, retopology, and asset texturing.
- **Refine animation workflows**: Experimenting with AI for animation refinement, character rigging, and procedural animation techniques.
- **Develop procedural content**: Leveraging procedural AI tools to generate 3D assets, backgrounds, and textures to enhance my project work.

## Goals and Objectives

This project serves as an experimental playground where I will:
- Explore **3D Tools** like Houdini and Maya, and **AI Tools** that support creative tasks.
- Develop and document workflows that integrate AI models into the creative process.
- Experiment with AI for improving the speed, quality, and flexibility of traditional 3D pipelines.

## Repository and Documentation

You can explore my project in the main GitHub repository, which contains:
- **Scripts** for AI-driven workflows.
- **Documentation** on tools and techniques used.
- **Experimentation logs** capturing my process, challenges, and results.

For more information on the tools I’m using, check out the **Context Streams** repository, where I list and describe my 3D tools and AI tools in detail:

## Why AI and 3D?

AI is rapidly evolving and has the potential to transform the 3D industry, from automating repetitive tasks to generating complex assets and animations. By combining my knowledge of 3D workflows with emerging AI tools, I hope to create innovative approaches that benefit both artists and designers.

## Next Steps

As I progress, I’ll be experimenting with various AI models, integrating them with my 3D workflow, and documenting my findings. I look forward to sharing insights and contributions to the evolving field of AI-assisted 3D art.
