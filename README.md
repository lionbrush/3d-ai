# 3d-ai

Welcome to my Applied AI and 3D Tools project repository! This repository is part of my journey exploring the intersection of AI and 3D modeling, animation, and design. Here, I’ll document my progress, tools, and techniques, as well as experiment with various AI models to enhance the 3D creative workflow.

## Overview

This project is focused on integrating AI and 3D tools for creating efficient workflows and producing compelling visuals. My goal is to combine advanced AI models with traditional 3D tools, experimenting with processes that could benefit artists and designers in fields like animation, VFX, game development, and 3D digital art.

- **Context Streams**: [Visit my Context Streams Repository](https://github.com/lionbrush/context-streams-for-applied-AI) where I list and describe the **3D Tools** and **AI Tools** I’m exploring in this project.

### Approaches to AI-Assisted 3D Character Creation & Animated Short Film Development

This repository provides resources and guides for anyone interested in the art of 3D character creation and short film production using AI-assisted tools. Whether you’re developing realistic creatures, stylized characters, or entire cinematic scenes, this guide outlines various approaches to combine AI with traditional techniques for more efficient and expressive results.

This repository includes the following sections:
1. [The Concept Development & Inspiration Method](concept-development.md)
2. [The Procedural-Based Design Method](procedural-design.md)
3. [The Rigging & Motion-Capture Enhancement Method](rigging-motion-capture.md)
4. [The Narrative & Visual Storytelling Method](narrative-storytelling.md)
5. [The Post-Production & FX Enhancement Method](post-production-fx.md)
