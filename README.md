# 3d-ai

Welcome to my Applied AI and 3D Tools project repository! This repository is part of my journey exploring the intersection of AI and 3D modeling, animation, and design. Here, I’ll document my progress, tools, and techniques, as well as experiment with various AI models to enhance the 3D creative workflow.

## Overview

This project is focused on integrating AI and 3D tools for creating efficient workflows and producing compelling visuals. My goal is to combine advanced AI models with traditional 3D tools, experimenting with processes that could benefit artists and designers in fields like animation, VFX, game development, and 3D digital art.

- **Introduction**: [Read my full introduction](introduction.md) to learn more about my background and goals for this project.
- **Context Streams**: [Visit my Context Streams Repository](https://github.com/username/context-streams-for-applied-AI) where I list and describe the **3D Tools** and **AI Tools** I’m exploring in this project.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes the following sections:
- **/src**: Contains scripts, code, and workflows I’m developing.
- **/docs**: Documentation, experimentation logs, and insights gathered throughout the project.
- **/assets**: Visual assets and media generated or used in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the resources in this repository, clone the repository and explore the documentation in each folder. You’ll find detailed instructions on the AI and 3D tools setup and how they contribute to my experiments.
