# 2. The Procedural & Template-Based Design Method

**Description**: This approach focuses on the technical aspects of model generation and procedural design, where AI aids in generating base models, textures, and topologies. The goal is to create adaptable, reusable templates that can speed up the modeling phase.

**Focus Areas**:
- Base model creation and refinement using tools like Meshy and ControlNet.
- Applying AI-generated textures and materials through procedural techniques.
- Establishing topology and UV mapping templates to streamline 3D model development.

**Tools**: Meshy, ControlNet, Houdini for procedural modeling.
