# 4. The Narrative & Visual Storytelling Method

**Description**: This approach uses AI to support storytelling, from developing plot points and dialog to structuring character arcs and scene compositions. It also includes cinematic choices, such as lighting and framing, that enhance narrative impact.

**Focus Areas**:
- AI-assisted scripting and dialog generation.
- Scene composition and lighting techniques for storytelling impact.
- Visual mood-setting through dynamic AI-driven lighting and atmospheric effects.

**Tools**: ChatGPT for plot/dialog generation, Unreal Engine (for cinematic lighting and camera setup), Blender or Maya for scene layout.
