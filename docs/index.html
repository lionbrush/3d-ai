    <h1>Experimenting with AI-Generated Video Derivatives from a 3D Orb Animation</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Hi Everybody!</p>
    <p>I recently rendered an animation of an orb with particles moving around inside.</p>
    
    <div class="video-container">
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uL-M5GB1zo">
            <img class="video-thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2uL-M5GB1zo/maxresdefault.jpg" 
                 alt="3D Orb Animation" 
                 title="Click to watch the video on YouTube">
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <p>It seemed like a great video for experimenting with various AI tools. Here's a summary of my journey and findings.</p>

    <h2>Runway Results</h2>
    <p>I started by testing the video in <strong>Runway</strong>, trying different materials to see what results it could generate. 
    However, some of the outputs were far from ideal, and unfortunately, I ran out of credits before being able to test further. 
    Still, I plan to revisit for improved results if I can.</p>

    <h2>Note on Still Images</h2>
    <p>Using a still image from the original animation produced notably better results in both <strong>Runway</strong> and <strong>Minimax</strong>. 
    This was an important takeaway that shaped the rest of my experiment.</p>

    <h2>Experimenting with ChatGPT and Midjourney</h2>
    <p>Since ChatGPT doesn't support video-to-video conversion, I instead used it to generate a prompt based on my original video. 
    Surprisingly, it produced a good starting prompt, which I then entered into <strong>Midjourney</strong>.</p>
